Annoying but they migrated the node package so alot of the old repos are dated which explains my completion issues
The new completions are displayed here: https://github.com/openai/openai-node/discussions/217

Step 1: Ensure the simple completions and stream work for GPT 3.5 and 4
Step 2: Send and manipulate the system messages
Step 3: extract the final mesasge JSON to get the entire response with all the parameters
